## Implementation

### Intermediate Files
- **test.py**
- **COLEMAK.py**
- **test_rsa_mod.py**

These files contain auxiliary code and are used for testing and intermediate steps in the implementation.

### Terminal Functionality
To test functionality using the terminal:
1. Run `test_client.py`.
2. Run `test_server.py`.

### GUI Functionality
To test the GUI-based chat application:
1. Run `server_chat_application.py`.
2. Run `client_chat_application.py`.

Ensure the server is running before starting the client.

## Methodology 2: Supporting Data of Any Size
This extended implementation allows the system to handle larger datasets efficiently.

### Steps to Test
1. Run `m2_server.py`.
2. Run `m2_client.py`.

Run the files in the specified order to ensure proper functionality.
